        1992. The band currently consists of Rivers Cuomo (lead vocals, lead

        After signing to Geffen Records in 1993, Weezer released their debut
        self-titled album, also known as the "Blue Album", in 1994. Backed by
        successful music videos for the singles "Buddy Holly", "Undone â€“ The
        Sweater Song" and "Say It Ain't So", the Blue Album became a 4x platinum
        success. Their second album, Pinkerton (1996), featuring a darker, more
        abrasive sound, was a commercial failure and initially received mixed
        reviews, but went on to achieve cult status and critical acclaim years
        later. Both the Blue Album and Pinkerton are now frequently cited among
        the best albums of the 1990s. Following the tour for Pinkerton, bassist
        Matt Sharp left the band and Weezer went on hiatus.
